# Gephi-Files
For those who would like to explore and manipulate the data without 
the steeper learning curve of connecting to the database and running the Python code
this repository contains exports of Shakeophere data that can be imported
and manipulated using the popular network analysis tool Gephi. Because of Github's 
maximum size constraints (25MB) we have divided the data into multiple slices:
1474-1700 (which covers the entirety of the "Networking Print" book, 1701-1799 (which 
lies outside the scope of that book and which includes data that still may need significant 
cleaning) and 1557-1640 (which covers the core period for analysis in the "Networking Print" book
and can be used to replicate and augment much of its visualization and analysis. 

Other files allow users to recreate visualization and analysis found in distinct parts of the "Networking Print" book.
